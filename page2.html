    <p>Sorrento is southern Italian town located over the famous Bay of Naples. I'd love to go to Italy to see some of the iconic historic locations and try some authentic Italian food. Me and my mom are actually planning to go to Italy next year! I am very excited to visit!</p>

    <p>Reykjav√≠k is the capital of Iceland and is home to over 100 volcanoes and various natural attractions, such as geothermal pools/spas and beautiful mountains and glaciers. I'd love to go to Iceland to see all the pretty landscapes and experience some cool cultural events if I'm lucky!</p>

    <p>Geneva is a Swiss city that is the second most populated in the country. It is often ranked as one of the most peaceful cities in the world for its low crime and friendly people. I'd love to go here mostly just for the sights and maybe to learn about the cultures and historic aspects of the place. I feel it'd be really interesting.</p>
